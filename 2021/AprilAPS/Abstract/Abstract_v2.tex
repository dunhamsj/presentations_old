thornado-Hydro: A Discontinuous Galerkin Method for General Relativistic Hydrodynamics with an Eye towards Simulating Core-Collapse Supernovae
\end{center}

We present results from thornado [1], a neutrino-hydrodynamics code we are developing, the ultimate goal of which is to simulate core-collapse supernovae using high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods [2]. Here, we focus on the module that solves the hydrodynamics equations under the conformally-flat approximation (CFA) to general relativity (GR) [3], and its coupling to Poseidon [4], a CFA gravity solver. GR is needed because Newtonian hydrodynamics underestimates the compactness of the proto-neutron star, which leads to lower neutrino luminosities [5]. We discuss details of the numerical method and show results from the self-similar collapse of a polytropic star [6], and the adiabatic collapse of a 15 solar mass progenitor using a tabulated, nuclear equation of state, capturing the dynamics up to bounce. The results from each of these test problems are compared with their Newtonian counterparts [7]. We also discuss future work, including coupling to our DG neutrino transport solver.
